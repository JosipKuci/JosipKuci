### Hi there 👋, my name is Josip Šimun Kuči
#### I am a 3rd year student of Computer Engineering at FERIT in Osijek
I am an aspiring embedded software engineer with a passion for automotive technology and low-level programming. My interest lies in creating efficient, reliable, and scalable embedded solutions that drive innovation in the automotive industry. With a strong foundation in C and C++, I thrive on solving complex problems at the hardware-software interface.

I am particularly excited about working on microcontroller-based systems, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and embedded Linux.
