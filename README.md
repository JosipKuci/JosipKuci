### Hi there 👋, my name is Josip Šimun Kuči
#### I am a 3rd year student of Computer Engineering at FERIT in Osijek
I am an aspiring embedded software engineer with a passion for automotive technology and low-level programming. My interest lies in creating efficient, reliable, and scalable embedded solutions that drive innovation in the automotive industry. With a strong foundation in C and C++, I thrive on solving complex problems at the hardware-software interface.

I am particularly excited about working on microcontroller-based systems, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and embedded Linux.

Skills: C/C++/C#/Java/Solidity

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a gameboy emulator to broaden my knowledge of C 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Real Time operating systems

### My coding journey 🚀
This is a short overview of all of my github repositories.
## High school 🏫
Most of my first projects were done in C++, such as my (https://github.com/JosipKuci/Space_Invaders)[Space Invaders clone] and (https://github.com/JosipKuci/Matrix-falling-letters)[Matrix falling letters screensaver]. While I am not proud of the way I structured my code back then, I think it shows how much I have improved in recent years.

For my high school thesis I did a (https://github.com/JosipKuci/Bike-Tourism-App-Cikilic)[Bike tourism app "Cikilic"], which was a collection of summaries of bike routes in the Osijek-Baranja county. While the UI left a lot to be desired, I learned a lot about Google Maps API-s as well as object-oriented programming in general.

## University 🏛️
The past few years I mostly did smaller learning projects such as the (https://github.com/JosipKuci/Johnson-Counter)[Johnson Counter] and (https://github.com/JosipKuci/Chaser-LED)[Chaser LED] written in VHDL for the E2LP development board

I also did a few (https://github.com/JosipKuci/A-collection-of-small-Solidity-projects)[Solidity projects] so that I could get to know the Blockchain and Web3 better.

After making a simple bootloader in assembly, I became to be interested in hardware emulation, so I made a (https://github.com/JosipKuci/Chip8-emulator)[Chip-8 emulator] in C. 
I consider it my best project to date because I applied all my current knowledge of project structuring and memory manipulation, I also enjoyed making it very much 😁.
Currently I am planning on optimising it for each game that uses it and adding UI as well as controller support.

## What's next?
For my Bachelor thesis I am making a Gameboy emulator because i think its more complex nature with timers, opcodes and the PPU proves as a good challenge and will help broaden my knowledge of emulation.

I am also currently working on a simple RTOS for the STM32 Nucleo F-411RE in hopes of learning about driver and kernel development and managing threads, as I would like to one day work on embedded Linux systems.
